## Impossibility Theorem

**Arrow's Impossibility Theorem** (1951) demonstrates that no voting system can simultaneously satisfy a set of seemingly reasonable conditions for democratic decision-making.


## Individual Preference Rankings

**Definition**: An individual preference ranking is an ordering of all available alternatives from most preferred to least preferred, with ties allowed, but not gaps.

## Individual Preference Rankings

We'll write A >~i~ B to mean that person i prefers A to B, and A =~i~ B to mean that person i thinks that A and B are equally good.

**Key Assumptions**:

- **Completeness**: Exactly one of A >~i~ B, B >~i~ A, and A =~i~ B holds.
- **Transitivity of Better**: If A >~i~ B and B >~i~ C, then A >~i~ C.
- **Transitivity of Equal**: If A =~i~ B and B =~i~ C, then A =~i~ C.

## Group Preference Rankings

We'll write A >~∀~ B to mean that the group prefers A to B, and A =~∀~ B to mean that the group thinks they are equally good.

**Same Key Assumptions**

- **Completeness**: Exactly one of A >~∀~ B, B >~∀~ A, and A =~∀~ B holds.
- **Transitivity of Better**: If A >~∀~ B and B >~∀~ C, then A >~∀~ C.
- **Transitivity of Equal**: If A =~∀~ B and B =~∀~ C, then A =~∀~ C.

## Big Question

How do we combine individual rankings into a single social ranking?

**What We Want**: A systematic method (social choice function) that takes individual preference profiles and produces a group preference ranking.

## Assumptions Again

There are a few strange things about the setup.

- Most of us don't have views about all possible outcomes of an election.
- The combination just takes individual *rankings* into account. It doesn't look at *strength* of preference.
- The output doesn't just ask for a winner, but for a full ordering.

## A Non-Answer

Say A >~∀~ B if more people have A >~i~ B than have B >~∀~ A, and A =~∀~ B if the numbers are the same.

This is a very simple kind of majoritarian rule.

## Condorcet Again

You can probably see where this is going. 

- Imagine that there are three options, A, B and C.
- And there are three voters, X, Y and Z.
- X has A >~X~ B >~X~ C.
- Y has B >~Y~ C >~Y~ A.
- Z has C >~Z~ A >~Z~ B.

## Condorcet Again

- Since two people (X and Z) prefer A to B, we have A >~∀~ B.
- Since two people (X and Y) prefer B to C, we have B >~∀~ C.
- Since two people (Y and Z) prefer C to A, we have C >~∀~ A.
- And we've violated transitivity.

## Plurality Again

Let's try a different solution.

- Ignore every part of >~i~ except who is top.
- For each option, give it 1 point for every voter for which it's the top option.
- If the voter has two options tied for top, give then 1/2 point each, and so on for more ties.
- Rank the options by how many points.

## Plurality Again

- This is guaranteed to satisfy the assumptions.
- Any approach where each option gets a number, and you rank the numbers, will produce the right kind of ordering.
- But it has a very strange result.

## Plurality Again

Imagine there are three options, A, B and C, and 100 voters. On Monday the preferences are like this:

- 40 people have A > B > C.
- 35 people have B > C > A.
- 25 people have C > B > A.
- So A wins, with 40 votes, and B is second, with 35.

## Plurality Again

On Tuesday, 10 of the people in the last group change their mind, just about B and C. So now we have.

- 40 people have A > B > C.
- 45 people have B > C > A.
- 15 people have C > B > A.
- So now B moves ahead of A in the social ranking, even though no one changed their mind abiout A and B.
- Is this odd?

## Arrow's Approach

Rather than going through options one at a time, let's find some principles.

- Start with a list of things we'd like the aggregation to be like.
- See what kind of things could meet all of the requirements on our list.

## Arrow's Theorem

For a very natural set of requirements, there are **zero** aggregation rules that satisfy all of them.

- Any aggregation rule you pick will have some slightly odd feature.

## Arrow's Requirements

Arrow identified four conditions that seem essential for any fair democratic system:

1. **Unrestricted Domain** (U)
2. **Weak Pareto Principle** (P)  
3. **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives** (I)
4. **Non-dictatorship** (D)

## Unrestricted Domain (U)

**What it means**: The voting system must work for ANY possible combination of individual preference rankings.

**Why it seems reasonable**: We shouldn't restrict what preferences people are allowed to have in a democracy.

## Weak Pareto Principle (P)

**What it means**: If everyone prefers alternative A to alternative B, then the group ranking should also prefer A to B.

**Why it seems reasonable**: If there's unanimous agreement, the social choice should reflect that agreement.

## Vilfredo Pareto

- He died around the time Mussolini came to power, and the Italian fascists claimed him as an inspiration. This *may* have been a misreading; he often sounds like a classical liberal.

## Pareto Principles

**Weak Pareto**: If for all i, A >~i~ B, then A >~∀~ B.

**Strong Pareto**: If for some i, A >~i~ B, and for no i B >~i~ A (but maybe there are some ties), then A >~∀~ B.

The latter is more contentious, but it isn't needed for the proof.

(In fact, all that the proof really needs is that every outcome is possible.)

## Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (I)

**What it means**: The social ranking between any two alternatives should depend *only* on how individuals rank those two alternatives, not on how they rank other alternatives.

**Key Insight**: Information about "irrelevant" third alternatives shouldn't change the relative ranking of two alternatives.

**Why it seems reasonable**: If we're deciding between A and B, it shouldn't matter what people think about C.


## IIA: Formal Statement

**Formal Definition**: For any two preference profiles R and R', if every individual has the same preference between alternatives A and B in both profiles, then the social choice between A and B must be the same in both profiles.

This isn't a property of how the aggregation function treats what happens on any given day; it's a property of how it treats possible changes in individual preferences.

## Non-dictatorship (D)

**What it means**: No single individual's preferences should always determine the group ranking, regardless of what others prefer.

**Why it seems reasonable**: This is basic to democratic ideals - no one person should have absolute power.

## Non-dictatorship (D)

**Formal statement**: For every individual i, there is some profile R and some pair of options A and B such that in R, 

**Note**: This doesn't prevent someone from being influential, just from being decisive in every case.

## The Impossibility Theorem

**Arrow's Theorem**: There is no social choice function that simultaneously satisfies:
- Unrestricted Domain (U)
- Weak Pareto Principle (P)
- Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (I)  
- Non-dictatorship (D)

**What this means**: Any democratic voting system must violate at least one of these seemingly reasonable conditions.

**The Proof Strategy**: Arrow showed that assuming all four conditions leads to a logical contradiction.

## Why This Matters for Philosophy

**Implications for Democratic Theory**:
- Challenges the idea of "the will of the people"
- Shows that aggregating preferences is fundamentally problematic
- Raises questions about the legitimacy of democratic outcomes

**Broader Philosophical Questions**:
- What does this tell us about collective rationality?
- Are there alternative approaches to social choice?
- How should we respond to this impossibility?

**Connection to Other Areas**:
- Philosophy of mind (collective vs. individual rationality)
- Political philosophy (legitimacy of democratic institutions)
- Ethics (how to make fair collective decisions)

---

## Common Responses and Escape Routes

**1. Restrict the Domain**: Limit the types of preferences allowed (violates U)

**2. Accept Dictatorship**: In limited contexts, expert decision-making (violates D)

**3. Drop IIA**: Accept that context matters in social choice (violates I)

**4. Probabilistic Methods**: Use randomization or cardinal utilities

**5. Alternative Frameworks**: Deliberative democracy, constitutional constraints

**The Debate Continues**: Each response involves trade-offs and philosophical commitments.

## Discussion Questions

1. Which of Arrow's four conditions would you be most willing to give up? Why?

2. Does Arrow's Theorem show that democracy is impossible, or just that perfect democracy is impossible?

3. How might this theorem apply to other collective decision-making contexts (committees, families, etc.)?

4. Do you think the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives condition is actually reasonable? Can you think of cases where context should matter?

5. What does this theorem tell us about the nature of collective rationality?
