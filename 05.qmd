# Pareto Principles

## Pareto Principles

Usually we focus on cases of conflict between individuals when talking about aggregation.

The cases where everyone agrees should be the easy case.

This intuition is formalised in the **Weak Pareto Principle**.

### Weak Pareto Principle

For any options A and B, if all voters agree that A > B, then A > ~$\forall$~ B.

## Pareto Principles

We're just going to look at that principle today, but as a reminder, the 'weak' there is because there is also a **Strong Pareto Principle**.

## Preferences and Interests

These Pareto principles are very important when we are thinking of aggregating everyone's **interests**.

What we'll see is that they aren't as compelling when we're aggregating everyone's **preferences**.

## Preferences and Interests

The **subjective theory of welfare** says that your interests, i.e., what makes you better off, are just your preferences.

There is an obvious (and well-known) problem with this.

You might hope for good things for someone else.

If those hopes are realised, that's good for them, not necessarily for you (especially if you never find out).

## Preferences and Interests

Things get even more complicated if some people in the community prefer that bad things happen to other people, or even that other people do not get what they want.

In those cases, Pareto principles will not be as compelling.
