# Course Overview

## Learning Objectives

::: {.incremental}
- Understand key concepts in [subject area]
- Apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems
- Develop critical thinking skills
- Engage with current research and debates
:::

::: {.notes}
Speaker notes: Remember to emphasize the practical applications and encourage questions throughout the lecture.
:::

## Today's Agenda

1. **Introduction** - Core concepts and definitions
2. **Theory** - Fundamental principles
3. **Applications** - Real-world examples
4. **Discussion** - Questions and implications

# Main Content

## Key Concept 1

- **Definition**: Clear, concise explanation of the concept
- **Context**: Why this matters in the field
- **Example**: Concrete illustration

::: {.callout-note}
## Important Note
This is a highlighted box that works in both HTML and PDF formats. Use these for key takeaways or important warnings.
:::

## Code Example

Here's how to include code that renders well in both formats:

```python
# Example Python code with syntax highlighting
def analyze_data(dataset):
    """
    Process and analyze the dataset
    """
    results = dataset.groupby('category').mean()
    return results.round(2)

# Usage
processed_data = analyze_data(my_dataset)
print(processed_data)
```

::: {.fragment}
Code explanations can be revealed incrementally in HTML presentations.
:::

## Visual Elements

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Left Column Content**

- Point one with explanation
- Point two with details
- Point three with context

This two-column layout works in both formats.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Right Column Content**

*Caption: Always include descriptive captions*
:::

::::

## Interactive Elements (HTML Only)

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Tab 1: Theory
Theoretical background and foundational concepts that students need to understand.

### Tab 2: Practice
Hands-on examples and exercises that reinforce the theoretical material.

### Tab 3: Resources
Additional readings, websites, and materials for further exploration.

:::

::: {.notes}
Note: Tabbed content will display as separate sections in PDF format.
:::

## Mathematical Expressions

Mathematical notation renders consistently across formats:

$$E = mc^2$$

Inline math also works: $\alpha + \beta = \gamma$

For more complex equations:

$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

## Discussion Questions

::: {.callout-tip}
## Think About This
- How does this concept relate to previous topics we've covered?
- What real-world applications can you think of?
- What questions do you have about the implementation?
:::

**Turn to your neighbor and discuss for 2 minutes, then we'll hear from a few groups.**

# Conclusion

## Summary

::: {.incremental}
1. **Key Point 1**: Brief summary of main concept
2. **Key Point 2**: Important takeaway message  
3. **Key Point 3**: Connection to broader course themes
:::

## Next Steps

- **Reading**: Chapter X in course textbook
- **Assignment**: Due date and brief description
- **Next Lecture**: Preview of upcoming topics

::: {.callout-important}
## Reminder
Don't forget about the upcoming assignment deadline and office hours schedule.
