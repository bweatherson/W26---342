# Sen's Paradox: The Impossibility of a Paretian Liberal

**Philosophy 300**  
*Social Choice Theory and Political Philosophy*

---

## Slide 1: Introduction

**Today's Question:**
Can we have both individual liberty and collective efficiency in social decision-making?

**Amartya Sen's Answer (1970):**
No - there is a fundamental logical impossibility.

**Key Insight:**
Even minimal commitments to individual freedom conflict with basic principles of collective rationality.

---

## Slide 2: Historical Context

**Background:**
- Arrow's Impossibility Theorem (1951) showed problems with democratic aggregation
- Economists and philosophers sought to reconcile individual rights with social welfare
- Sen's result (1970) deepened the crisis in social choice theory

**Sen's Contribution:**
Showed that even very weak liberal principles create impossibilities when combined with Pareto efficiency.

---

## Slide 3: The Pareto Principle

**Definition:**
A social state A is Pareto superior to state B if:
- At least one person prefers A to B
- No one prefers B to A

**Pareto Optimality:**
A state is Pareto optimal if no Pareto superior alternative exists.

**Why This Matters:**
Pareto efficiency seems like a minimal requirement for rational collective choice.

---

## Slide 4: Liberal Rights

**Sen's Minimal Liberalism:**
There exists at least one pair of social alternatives over which each individual has decisive power.

**Examples:**
- Choosing what to read
- Deciding personal lifestyle matters
- Making private consumption choices

**Key Point:**
This is an extremely weak conception of individual liberty - much weaker than typical liberal theories require.

---

## Slide 5: The Formal Setup

**Elements:**
- Set of individuals: {1, 2, ..., n}
- Set of social alternatives: {x, y, z, ...}
- Individual preference orderings over alternatives
- Social choice function that selects outcomes

**Goal:**
Find a social choice method that respects both Pareto efficiency and minimal liberal rights.

---

## Slide 6: Sen's Theorem Statement

**The Impossibility of a Paretian Liberal:**

There is no social choice function that simultaneously satisfies:
1. **Pareto Principle** (Weak Pareto)
2. **Minimal Liberalism** (Liberal condition L)
3. **Unrestricted Domain** (all logically possible preference profiles)

**Implication:**
We must give up at least one of these seemingly reasonable conditions.

---

## Slide 7: The Lady Chatterley Example

**Setup:**
- Person A (prude): Prefers no one reads Lady Chatterley's Lover
- Person B (liberal): Wants everyone to have freedom to choose
- Three alternatives:
  - x: A reads, B doesn't read
  - y: B reads, A doesn't read  
  - z: Neither reads

---

## Slide 8: Individual Preferences in the Example

**Person A's preferences:**
1. z (neither reads) - best
2. y (B reads, A doesn't) - acceptable
3. x (A reads, B doesn't) - worst

**Person B's preferences:**
1. y (B reads, A doesn't) - best
2. x (A reads, B doesn't) - acceptable  
3. z (neither reads) - worst

---

## Slide 9: Liberal Rights Applied

**A's Liberal Right:**
A should decide whether A reads or not.
- A prefers not reading to reading
- So A has decisive power: x is socially worse than y

**B's Liberal Right:**
B should decide whether B reads or not.
- B prefers reading to not reading
- So B has decisive power: z is socially worse than y

---

## Slide 10: The Pareto Ranking

**Pareto Comparison:**
- Both A and B prefer z to x
- Therefore, by Pareto principle: z is socially preferred to x

**The Cycle:**
- Liberal rights: x < y (from A's right)
- Liberal rights: z < y (from B's right)  
- Pareto principle: x < z
- Result: x < z < y and y > x, creating intransitivity

---

## Slide 11: Why This Creates Impossibility

**The Problem:**
We get a cycle in social preferences:
- x is worse than y (A's liberal right)
- z is worse than y (B's liberal right)
- x is worse than z (Pareto principle)
- But we need a transitive social ordering

**No Consistent Choice:**
There's no way to rank these three alternatives that respects all our principles.

---

## Slide 12: Philosophical Implications

**For Liberalism:**
- Even minimal individual rights can conflict with collective rationality
- Pure procedural liberalism may be incoherent

**For Utilitarianism:**
- Pareto efficiency (a weak form of utility maximization) conflicts with rights

**For Democracy:**
- Social choice mechanisms face deeper problems than Arrow's theorem suggested

---

## Slide 13: Attempted Solutions - Restricting Domain

**Strategy:**
Limit the types of preferences people can have.

**Examples:**
- Exclude "nosy" preferences about others' choices
- Require value-restricted preferences
- Assume single-peaked preferences

**Problem:**
This seems to violate liberal neutrality about what preferences people should have.

---

## Slide 14: Attempted Solutions - Weakening Pareto

**Strategy:**
Modify or abandon the Pareto principle.

**Approaches:**
- Use only Pareto comparisons where rights aren't involved
- Priority for rights over efficiency
- Context-dependent application

**Debate:**
Is Pareto efficiency really essential to rational social choice?

---

## Slide 15: Attempted Solutions - Redefining Rights

**Strategy:**
Reconceptualize what individual rights mean.

**Approaches:**
- Rights as constraints rather than preferences
- Procedural vs. substantive rights
- Game-form rights (Gaertner, Pattanaik, Suzumura)

**Key Insight:**
Maybe rights shouldn't be modeled as individual decisiveness over outcomes.

---

## Slide 16: The Rights-Based Response

**Nozickian Approach:**
- Rights are side-constraints, not goals to be maximized
- Process matters more than outcomes
- Social choice theory asks the wrong questions

**Critique of Sen:**
Perhaps the framework of social choice is inappropriate for thinking about rights and liberty.

---

## Slide 17: Contemporary Relevance

**Modern Applications:**
- Privacy vs. security trade-offs
- Individual choice vs. public health (vaccination, mask mandates)
- Environmental regulation vs. personal freedom
- Market outcomes vs. distributive justice

**The Core Question:**
How do we balance individual autonomy with collective welfare in democratic societies?

---

## Slide 18: Methodological Lessons

**For Philosophy:**
- Formal methods can reveal hidden contradictions in our moral concepts
- Intuitive principles may be logically incompatible
- Precision in definition matters enormously

**For Political Theory:**
- Simple solutions to complex normative problems should be viewed with suspicion
- Trade-offs between values may be unavoidable

---

## Slide 19: Critical Assessment

**Strengths of Sen's Argument:**
- Rigorous formal demonstration
- Challenges comfortable assumptions
- Reveals deep structural problems

**Potential Limitations:**
- Very specific formal framework
- May not capture how rights actually function
- Limited conception of both liberalism and efficiency

---

## Slide 20: Conclusion and Discussion

**Sen's Lasting Contribution:**
Showed that some of our most basic political values are in logical tension.

**Open Questions:**
1. Can we develop better formal models of rights and liberty?
2. Should we prioritize rights over efficiency, or vice versa?
3. What does this mean for practical democratic institutions?

**For Next Class:**
How might we move beyond impossibility results toward constructive theories of justice?
