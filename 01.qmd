# Introduction

## The Course

This is **Philosophy 342**: Introduction to Theory of Choice in Groups.

It introduces a bunch of topics that have the following features:

1. They are to do with human choices;
2. They raise philosophically interesting questions; and
3. At least some of these questions arise from how choices by different people interact.

## Books

Both books are available through the library, which has a subscription to the Cambridge Elements series.

There is also a Canvas site which has a number of readings on it, though we won't start those for a little bit.

## More Books

If you are interested in the material, and would like to investigate more, the two books to start with are:

- *Collective Choice and Social Action*, Amartya Sen, 1970.
- *The Evolution of Cooperation*, Robert Axelrod, 1984.

We'll talk about the material in both of these as the course progresses, and neither is **required**, but they are both deservedly classics.

## Plan

The course will be in two halves, roughly pivoting around the mid-term break.

1. Pooling - how do we form collective attitudes out of individual attitudes?
2. Modeling - what can we learn about social structures by looking at very simple models of them?

## A Hypothetical

It's easiest to understand some of the puzzles about pooling with an example.

Let's start by imagining a future world where the NFL, in its wisdom, has gone from having a single replay official to having three replay officials, who have to vote on close calls.
